    story: `Sports Blueprint was founded in 2014 by former collegiate athletes who saw a gap in the market — talented young athletes with no access to structured, professional development. What started as weekend training sessions in a local park has grown into a full-scale athletic performance organization serving 500+ athletes annually.

We believe that greatness isn't reserved for the gifted few. It's built — rep by rep, session by session, day by day. That's the Sports Blueprint philosophy.`,
    mission: "To empower every athlete — regardless of background or experience level — with the tools, coaching, and community they need to reach their highest potential.",
    vision: "To be the most trusted name in athletic development, producing champions on the field and leaders in life.",
